# VHDL Projects

The source code for various investigations.

## Adder Tree

*Theme:* Recursive structures in hardware description languages

See blog post [Adder Trees Pipelined Efficiently by Recursion](http://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/adder-trees-pipelined-efficiently-by-recursion)

But does the recursive adder tree provide any advantage?

## BRAM

See blog post [Cascade Block RAMs for Larger Memories](http://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/cascade-block-rams-for-larger-memories)

## Comparator

*Theme:* Recursive structures in hardware description languages

See blog post [Large Comparators Pipelined Efficiently by Recursion](http://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/large-comparator-pipelined-efficiently-by-recursion)

## LFSR

Substituting _Linear Feedback Shift Register_ counters for synchronous equivalents to avoid the carry chain delay.

See blog post [Swapping Synchronous and LFSR Counters](http://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/swapping-synchronous-and-lfsr-counters)

## Local

A library of testing functions with which to build test benches for VHDL projects. This is required to be compiled before using any other VHDL sources in this repository.

## Polynomial

Calculating CRCs etc multiple bits per clock cycle.

See blog post [Bus-width Polynomial Division Logic](http://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/bus-width-polynomial-division-logic)

## Signal Spies

Familiarisation with VHDL-2008 "_External Signals_" and ModelSim "_Signal Spies_". Trying to understand some superficial explanations.

See blog post [Comparison of ModelSim 'Signal Spies' and VHDL 'External Signals'](http://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/comparison-of-modelsim-signal-spies-and-vhdl-external)
